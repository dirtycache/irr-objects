 1. Subnet Assigned (CIDR notation): 44.76.16.0/24

    a. Does your NSP (or you) need an ALTDB RDB
       route object entered for this prefix? (Y/N):

	No. We maintain all objects related to AS 397677 in the NTTCOM IRR.
	RADB mirrors from NTTCOM, and in turn ALTDB mirrors RADB.

15. Describe how this subnet will be used and how that usage
    will benefit the Amateur Radio community:

	Disclaimer: I'm new to AMPRnet and only recently joined the 44net
	mailing list.  The following is just some brainstorming and ideas which
	may or may not be consistent with how things are already done.  It is my
	intention to lurk first and learn. 

	Ongoing experimentation with and services relating to and with
	radio-based networking.  Given that:

	a) The summary prefix 44.0.0.0/9 is announced via AS7377 which
	generally presents ~40ms RTT from Houston, Texas.

	b) A cursory analysis of gateways within 44.76/16 reveals that
	most connect via commodity residential internet services - cable modems
	and DSL.

	c) Houston, despite being the fourth largest US city, is
	completely bereft of any IP carrier peering; most traffic peers in
	Dallas.  That said, many common area ISPs transit between each other
	within Houston (example: Comcast and Level3) so this may help regional
	traffic.

	d) I'd like to perhaps deploy a local analog to the OH7LZB
	Finnish OpenVPN service.  Obviously this won't improve RTT to AS7377
	directly, but may help decrease latency for US-based connections.

16. Anything else we should know?:

	Not that I can think of this time.

17. Network Service Provider name:

	NetDepot 

18. NSP postal address:

	2626 Spring Cypress Rd
	Spring TX 77388

19. NSP telephone:

20. NSP email contact:

	support@netdepot.com	

21. NSP ASN:

	11042

22. Will your NSP and/or its upstream providers require
   a written, signed-on-letterhead formal LoA?  (Note: a
   'Yes' answer may delay your application by several days.)
   Y/N?:

	It's possible.  Haven't gotten a definitive answer yet, so let's
	assume "yes" so we get all NSPs and upstreams in one go.  
	However, PLEASE don't contact NSPs without at least making me aware 
	of the need to do so - they won't necessarily know who you are and 
	may bitbucket the request.

NOTE: If it is required for your NSP's upstreams to be included
   in the formal LoA, please repeat list items 17 thru 21 above
   for each that should be so included.
